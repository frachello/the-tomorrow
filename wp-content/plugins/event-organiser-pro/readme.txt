**Markup changes**  

* Button, bookee name and bookee email fields now appear on the form customiser. If you have edited the booking form template or added your own styling, you may need to make some alterations. See [this post](http://wp-event-organiser.com/blog/announcements/booking-form-template-changes-1-8/) for more details
* The 'log-in form' (appears to logged-out users, if you want such users to log-in) has been moved to the top of the booking form. The form itself is now initially hidden.

* Sublabels in fields are given the class `.eo-booking-sub-label`.
* Added `.eo-booking-field-gateway` class to gateway selection fields. Removed `<br>` tag

**API changes**  

* Added hooks `eventorganiser_delete_booking_ticket` and `eventorganiser_deleted_booking_ticket` triggered when tickets in a booking are deleted.
